  * Lorenzo:
    * Handling ambiguity & problem solving -overanalyzing to the point of counter-productivity
  * Kassie:
    * Communication

* How do you plan to approach the day-to-day development:
  * Code review: look over the tasks we aim to accomplish for the day and affirm we understand enough of the code to get them done.

### Conflict Resolution

* What will we do if one person is pulling all the weight:
  * No reading between the lines - be straight up. Don't waste energy.

* What will we do if one person is taking over the project:
  * No reading between the lines - be straight up. Don't waste energy. No harm in trying things even if they don't end up working. Don't be afraid of failure or different solutions

* How will you approach each other and the challenge of building an application:
  * Lean in to each other's strengths and be honest about our own struggle and understanding.
